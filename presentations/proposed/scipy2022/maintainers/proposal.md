## Title

Scientific Python---By Maintainers and for Maintainers


## Short Summary

The future of Scientific Python is here.
Behind the scenes, core scientific projects have started coordinating to better unify the community.
Learn more about the goals of this unification effort, opportunities that exist, and, most importantly, how to join the adventure.


## Abstract

The Scientific Python project's vision is to help pave the way towards a unified, expanded scientific Python community.
It focuses its efforts along two primary axes: _(i)_ to create a joint community around all scientific projects
and _(ii)_ to support maintainers by building cross-cutting technical infrastructure and tools.
This talk will focus on the second aspect, presenting current and future initiatives.

The project has already launched a process whereby projects can, voluntarily, adopt reference guidelines;
these are known as SPECs or Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination documents.
SPECs are similar to projects specific guidelines like PEPs, NEPs, SLEPs, and SKIPs, to name a few.
The distinction being that SPECs have a broader scope, targeted at all (or most) projects from the scientific Python ecosystem.

The project also provides and maintains tools to help maintainers.
This includes a theme for the project websites (currently used on, e.g., numpy.org and scipy.org), a self-hosted privacy-friendly
web analytics platform, a community discussions forum, a technical blog, and project development statistics.

We present all these tools, discuss various upcoming SPECs, and highlight the project's future potential.

The talk closes with a general call to action.
The Scientific Python project is already supported by eight core projects: IPython, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and SciPy.
The organization has spent the last several months working on the infrastructure, and is now ready to engage more widely to help grow and support the community.
